             <br/><br><hr/><h3><mark>A LITTLE OF ME</mark></h3>
                <p1>Hi everyone! I'm a bit of an anomaly. For the past year, I've been on the front lines as a junior doctor, proudly serving patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. It's been an incredibly challenging but rewarding experience, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have made a real difference in people's lives.<br><br/>Community health care played a vital role during COVID-19.<img src="https://www.bryantstratton.edu/~/media/outcomes-community-health-worker-300x250.ashx?la=en&hash=41A6A4C7901B5D2E5EFF6EC9905F6A3670E835AD" height="200" width="200"
                    Here's a summary:

                    <br/><li>Trusted Outreach: Workers informed communities, built trust, and addressed misinformation.</li>
                    <br/><li>Contact Tracing: They helped track and manage the spread of the virus.</li>
                    <br/><li>Vulnerable Care: Provided support to those isolating at home, including food and medicine.</li>
                    <br/><li>Vaccination: Assisted with vaccine education and rollout efforts.</li><img src="https://www.un.org/africarenewal/sites/www.un.org.africarenewal/files/styles/ar_paragraph_wide_photo/public/images/HLM4461.jpg?itok=Ahg-b1JX" height="200" width="200"
                    
                <br><br/>But outside of the hospital, I've discovered a whole new passion – the intricate language of code! While my background might be in healthcare, I've recently been captivated by the creativity and problem-solving aspects of coding. Right now, I'm diving headfirst into the world of frontend technologies, building the user interfaces that bring websites and applications to life. Java is on my radar too, but for now, I'm thrilled to be exploring the visual side of coding and the possibilities it holds.
                
                <br><br/>Who knows, maybe someday I'll be able to bridge the gap between my medical knowledge and coding skills to create something truly innovative in the healthcare field. But for now, I'm excited to be on this new journey, one line of code at a time.</p1>

                <br><br/><p2>Outside of the hospital, I'm a <i><u>passionate traveler</u></i>, forever seeking new adventures. I also love to unwind with a good book, get lost in the world of music, and express myself through writing. Recently, life took an exciting turn – I moved to Canada with my husband for his work!</p2>
